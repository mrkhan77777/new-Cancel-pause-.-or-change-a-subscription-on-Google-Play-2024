What are Content Ratings?
Content ratings indicate the minimum maturity level required for users to safely interact with apps or games. They provide guidance on whether an app is suitable for specific age groups based on factors like violence, sexual content, gambling, and language.
Who Assigns the Ratings?
Ratings are assigned by the app‚Äôs developer using the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) system, ensuring consistency across regions. In some countries (e.g., South Korea), local authorities like GRAC approve these ratings.
Why Are Ratings Important?
To inform users about potentially sensitive content.
To help parents or guardians ensure content is appropriate for children.
To comply with regional laws or policies regarding app visibility.
Interactive Features:
Apps may include specific interactive elements, such as:
Sharing a user‚Äôs location.
Allowing direct communication between users.
These features are described in the ‚ÄúRead More‚Äù section and are not part of the content rating.
Unrated Apps:
Apps without a rating are treated as high-maturity content. If you use parental controls, such apps will be automatically restricted until rated.
